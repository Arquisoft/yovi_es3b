== Context and Scope

This section describes the system as a black box, showing its interactions with external actors and systems.
It also presents the technical interfaces used between the main
subsystems.

=== Business Context

YOVI is a software platform designed to allow users to play the game Y
through a web application, while also enabling automated interaction
through an external API consumed by bots. The system provides gameplay
functionality, user management, statistics tracking, and game validation
through a dedicated game engine.

From a business perspective, the system offers:

* A web interface for playing the classic version of the game Y.
* User registration and management.
* Game history and statistics visualization.
* An external API for automated clients (bots).
* Game validation and move suggestion functionalities.

|===
|Actor / External System
|Interaction with YOVI

|Web User
|Plays matches, selects strategies, and consults statistics.

|External Bot
|Uses the public API to play games automatically.

|Game Engine
|Checks win conditions and suggests next moves.

|Web Deployment Platform
|Provides public access to the system.

=== Technical Context

At a technical level, YOVI is composed of several subsystems that
communicate using web protocols and JSON messages, including the
YEN notation for representing game states.

==== Main Technical Containers

===== Web Application (TypeScript)

Responsibilities:

* User interface.
* User interaction and gameplay visualization.
* Access to backend services.

===== Backend API

Responsibilities:

* Application orchestration.
* User and game management.
* Exposure of the external API for bots.
* Communication with the game engine.

===== Game Engine (Rust)

Responsibilities:

* Game state validation.
* Win detection.
* Move suggestion according to selected strategies.

===== Database (if present in the final architecture)

Responsibilities:

* Persistent storage of users.
* Game history.
* Statistics.

=== Scope

YOVI is responsible for:

* Managing user accounts and authentication.
* Handling game sessions and history.
* Validating game states.
* Detecting win conditions.
* Providing move suggestions for players.
* Exposing a public API for automated bots.

YOVI is not responsible for:

* Payment processing or external financial transactions.
* Cross-game matchmaking platforms.
* Third-party authentication providers (OAuth, SSO).
* External infrastructure management (servers, cloud services).

=== Mapping Input / Output

==== Inputs

* User interactions through the web interface.
* API requests from external bots.
* Board states encoded using YEN notation.

==== Outputs

* Updated game state.
* Match results (win / ongoing).
* User statistics.
* Suggested moves returned by the game engine.
