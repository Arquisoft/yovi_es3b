== Context and Scope

This section describes the system as a black box, showing its interactions with external actors and systems.
It also presents the technical interfaces used between the main
subsystems.

=== Business Context

YOVI is a software platform designed to allow users to play the game Y
through a web application, while also enabling automated interaction
through an external API consumed by bots. The system provides gameplay
functionality, user management, statistics tracking, and game validation
through a dedicated game engine.

From a business perspective, the system offers:

* A web interface for playing the classic version of the game Y.
* User registration and management.
* Game history and statistics visualization.
* An external API for automated clients (bots).
* Game validation and move suggestion functionalities.

==== External Actors

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Actor / External System
|Interaction with YOVI

|Web User
|Plays matches, selects strategies, and consults statistics.

|External Bot
|Uses the public API to play games automatically.

|Game Engine
|Checks win conditions and suggests next moves.

|Web Deployment Platform
|Provides public access to the system.

=== Technical Context

At a technical level, YOVI is composed of several subsystems that
communicate using web protocols and JSON messages, including the
YEN notation for representing game states.

==== Main Technical Containers

===== Web Application (TypeScript)

Responsibilities:

* User interface.
* User interaction and gameplay visualization.
* Access to backend services.

===== Backend API

Responsibilities:

* Application orchestration.
* User and game management.
* Exposure of the external API for bots.
* Communication with the game engine.

===== Game Engine (Rust)

Responsibilities:

* Game state validation.
* Win detection.
* Move suggestion according to selected strategies.

===== Database (if present in the final architecture)

Responsibilities:

* Persistent storage of users.
* Game history.
* Statistics.

==== Technical Context Diagram

[NOTE]
====
Include here a **Container Diagram (C4 Level 2)** showing:

* Browser / Client
* Frontend Web Application
* Backend API
* Game Engine (Rust)
* Database

Relationships should indicate:

* HTTPS communication between browser and frontend
* REST/JSON between frontend and backend
* REST/JSON (YEN) between backend and game engine
* Persistence connection between backend and database
====

==== Optional Improvement (Recommended)

[NOTE]
====
Optionally, include a **UML Component Diagram** for the Backend API showing internal components such as:

* User Management
* Game Management
* Strategy Manager
* Persistence Layer
* Game Engine Adapter

This is not mandatory but helps bridge this section with the internal architecture described later.

=== Mapping Input / Output

==== Inputs

* User interactions through the web interface.
* API requests from external bots.
* Board states encoded using YEN notation.

==== Outputs

* Updated game state.
* Match results (win / ongoing).
* User statistics.
* Suggested moves returned by the game engine.
