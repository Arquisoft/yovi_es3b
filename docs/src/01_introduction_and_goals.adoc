== 1. Introduction and Goals
Software development company Micrati has decided to shift its focus
to the development of a video game based on the classical board game Y.
The new game will be named *YOVI*.

YOVI is a two-player strategy game in which each player is assigned a color.
The board consists of hexagonal tiles arranged in a triangular shape.
Players take turns placing a piece of their assigned color on an empty tile.
The objective of the game is to connect the three sides of the triangular board
with a continuous path of pieces of the same color.

The main goal of the project is to deliver a deployed, accessible,
and scalable web-based system that allows users to play Y against
the computer with multiple strategies and configurable difficulty levels,
while also exposing a documented API for bot interaction.

Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider.
These include

* underlying business goals,
* essential features,
* essential functional requirements,
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

=== 1.1 Requirements Overview
The system will be composed of two main subsystems:

* A Web Application implemented in TypeScript that allows users to:
** Play games through a graphical interface.
** Register and manage their accounts.
** Access statistics and match history.
** Interact through a public API that enables bot integration.

* A Game Engine module implemented in Rust responsible for:
** Determining whether a match has been won.
** Suggesting the next move based on different strategies.
** Providing a basic web service interface to be invoked by the Web Application.

Communication between both subsystems will be performed through JSON
messages using the YEN (Y Notation) format to represent game states.

==== 1.1.1 Functional Requirements

The system must fulfill the following functional requirements:

* The system shall provide a web-based frontend that allows users
to play the classical version of the Y game.

* The system shall allow a human player to play against the computer.

* The board size shall be configurable.

* The system shall implement more than one computer strategy.
Each strategy may include different difficulty levels,
which can be selected by the user.

* The system shall allow users to register and authenticate.

* The system shall store and display user statistics, including:
** Number of games played.
** Number of games won and lost.
** Additional performance metrics if necessary.

* The system shall provide a public REST API that allows:
** Access to user information.
** Access to match information.
** Management of matches.
** Interaction from external bots.

* The API shall include a method `play` that:
** Receives at least a parameter `position` in YEN notation.
** Returns the next move in YEN notation.
** Optionally allows the selection of strategy and difficulty.

* The system shall be deployed and accessible via the Web.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

=== 1.2 Quality Goals

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Priority |Quality Goal |Concrete Description

|1
|Performance
|The system shall return a move suggestion from the Rust engine in less than 1 second
for standard board sizes under normal load conditions (up to 50 concurrent users).

|2
|Scalability
|The system shall support at least 50 concurrent authenticated users playing matches
simultaneously without service degradation (response times above 2 seconds or request failures).

|3
|Availability
|The deployed system shall achieve at least 99% uptime measured on a monthly basis,
excluding scheduled maintenance.

|4
|Modifiability
|It shall be possible to add a new computer strategy without modifying the Web frontend
and without changing existing strategy implementations (Open/Closed Principle).
Integration of a new strategy should require changes only within the Rust engine module.

|5
|Usability
|A new user shall be able to register and start a game in less than 5 minutes
without external documentation. The interface shall clearly indicate:
current turn, selected strategy, board size, and game result.

|6
|Interoperability
|The public REST API shall follow standard HTTP conventions and JSON format,
and it shall be fully documented (e.g., OpenAPI). External bots shall be able to
interact with the `play` endpoint without accessing internal implementation details.

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

=== 1.3 Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
